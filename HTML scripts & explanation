# For new learners such as me I have created the website to record the language and its common usage code shown as below. If I have new updated code please check the remarks firstly.
# The basic script of HTML website code should be shown as below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your website title</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

# Let us check the meaning of the basic code.
# The first line we can see "<", "!" and ">". That is comments in HTML language. Also it includes some functional code to make sure running the needed functions.
# So let us check the contents. "DOCTYPE" means document type, it's going to tell the browser that the HTML page version. 
# HTML is a text type in website so it can be read by humankind easily. If you don't want to read this you can ignore this sentence. Alought you have read.

# The second line 'lang="en"' means the website shown as English. You can change it as "cn" or like "en-US". Please remind it if you want a multi language website.

# The third line "<head>" and its ending "</head>" means submit to browser the website headers infomation.

# The forth line "meta" means the "metadata" in website, it is a basic data information in website. And the 'charset="UTF-8"' means 'character set = "UTF-8". The "UTF-8" is decoded for Chinese website. If not the decode way to browse Chinese website it may shown as "锟斤拷烫烫烫".

# Other sentence for new learners we don't need to understand the meaning.

# This is the scripts & explanation of HTML code.
