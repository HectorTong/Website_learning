# In your website if we want to make a list, how do we make it?
# In HTML we have order list and disorder list, the usage shown as below:

# Order list:

<ol>有序列表1</ol>
<ol>有序列表2</ol>
<ol>有序列表3</ol>

# When you check this you can see the number in the front of the list.

# Now let's see how to create a table in HTML.
# In HTML if we want to create a table. First we must create a new category "<table>", or it won't work.
# For table it has row & column, for row we can use table row shown as below:

<table>
  <tr>第一行</tr>
  <tr>第二行</tr>
  <tr>第三行</tr>
</table>

# If we want to make the first row for each table column as title, we can use table header shown as below:

<table>
  <tr>第一行</tr>
    <th>列标题1</th>
    <th>列标题2</th>
    <th>列标题3</th>
  <tr>第二行</tr>
  <tr>第三行</tr>
</table>

# And we have title of each table column, we can fill in table data shown as below:

<table>
  <tr>第一行</tr>
    <th>列标题1</th>
    <th>列标题2</th>
    <th>列标题3</th>
  <tr>第二行</tr>
    <td>元素1</td>
    <td>元素2</td>
    <td>元素3</td>
  <tr>第三行</tr>
    <td>元素1</td>
    <td>元素2</td>
    <td>元素3</td>
</table>

# If we want to make our table beauty, we can add 'border=""' in "<table>" tag like below:

<table border="1">
  <tr>第一行</tr>
    <th>列标题1</th>
    <th>列标题2</th>
    <th>列标题3</th>
  <tr>第二行</tr>
    <td>元素1</td>
    <td>元素2</td>
    <td>元素3</td>
  <tr>第三行</tr>
    <td>元素1</td>
    <td>元素2</td>
    <td>元素3</td>
</table>
